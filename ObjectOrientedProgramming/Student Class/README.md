# Creating a Student Object with C++

This project is designed to provide a basic understanding of object oriented programming in C++.

The series of files included in this repository are all related to creating a student class, which has numerous attributes and implementations. The class is defined in a header file, the methods are implemented in a cpp file, and the main file is used for instantiating the student class and testing its functionality.

This is a great resource for anyone who is new to object oriented programming or wants to learn more about it in the C++ language. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a starting point for your own projects.
