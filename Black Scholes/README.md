# European Vanilla Call/Put Options Using Black Scholes

Welcome to my C++ script that computes the value of a European call/put option using the Black-Scholes model.

This script takes in various parameters of the model as inputs and uses in-built functions to perform the calculations. It is a simple yet powerful tool for options traders, financial analysts, and students of finance to quickly and accurately compute option prices.

The script is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for those looking to learn more about the Black-Scholes model. Feel free to use and modify the script for your own purposes.
